# ledInterrupt_temperture
This code for led Interruot and temperture sensor on Arduino
I wanted to have led that admits it was pressed once, then it would state the status of the led either it's High or low.
The other application was for checking the temperature.
First one was tested by constructing the board, and the other one was tested using Proteus.
I think this was helpful project, since I learned that bouncing time and transient is different on real life and the button it's self can affect bouncing time.
For the experience I have had some project on Arduino like drone and car obstacle avoidance.
Connections are attached in Issues section.
